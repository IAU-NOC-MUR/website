Leena Ramessur is a Physics Educator at Saint Mary’s West College. She graduated with a BSc (Hons) Physics with a minor in Astrophysics at the University of Mauritius (UoM). Her fascination with STEM and Astronomy, in particular, led her to undertake several modules during her undergraduate studies, including ‘Introduction to Astronomy’, ‘Astronomical Techniques’, and ‘Astrophysics’. Her final year dissertation involved looking at a novel area of research with regards to Transient Astronomy with a strong emphasis on Extragalactic Transients, such as the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). She also completed her Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) from the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE). Her aim as an Educator is to positively influence and inspire more and more students to opt for astronomy and STEM for their higher studies.
