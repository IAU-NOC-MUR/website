I am Doctoral candidate in field of Theoretical Cosmology and Modified gravity at the Cosmology Gravity Research Group, University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa. I currently hold a Master’s Degree in observational radio astronomy in field of Black hole X-ray Binaries. I had topped my BSc. (Hons) degree in Physics with computing, with minor in astronomy from University of Mauritius.

After which, I am very grateful to have been recipient of National Research Foundation
Funding for Square Kilometer Array Masters Award 2013 and for Doctoral Innovation Award
2016\. Without these support, I would not been able to embark on this wonderful journey in
cosmology.

I am passionately curious about the Universe. During my PhD studies, I specialize in understanding General Relativity (i.e. Einstein’s theory of Gravity) and fundamentals of how the Universe was created from the Big Bang Singularity and how its large-scale structure was formed until present. The main idea behind my thesis isto conceptualize a new gravity theory and construct new cosmological model in attempt to explain two main cosmological puzzles. One is the accelerated expansion of the Universe at present time and the other is the Hubble tension which exists between the observational constraints of the early and late universe.

I have been a teaching assistant for Honors Course for National Space Science Program during 2019-2021 and General Relativity and other applied mathematics courses.

At the University of Cape Town, I transformed into developing my leadership skills as the Head student of Obz Square Residence 2014. I had opportunity to serve as Chair of Sports in Student Representative Council (SRC) 2014/15, which is the highest student body. I directed my service as the Vice-President of UCT Space and Astronomy Society 2016, and the Chair of UCT ITF Taekwondo 2017.

I am very thankful to have been TEDx UCT Speaker in 2019 and a Judge for Eskom Young
Scientist Competition in Cape Town.
