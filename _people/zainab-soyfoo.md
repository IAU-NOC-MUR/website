Zainab Soyfoo holds a Bachelor’s degree in English from the University of Mauritius,
a Postgraduate Certificate of Education in English and a Masters degree in Education
from the University of Brighton.

The focus of her latest research was based on Holistic Education promoting the notion
that there is more to a learner than just the cognitive aspect. In line with UNESCO,
she supports the view that wholeness in human beings involves their intellectual,
social, psychological, emotional and physical development – a perspective neglected
by mainstream education.

Her vocation as an English educator at secondary schools and a part-time drama tutor
at the Mauritius Institute of education is based on a dynamic approach to learning.
She involves various hands-on activities to keep the learning process engaging and
efficient. This is echoed in her innovative leading style that she has brought to Aurora
Toastmasters Club as Vice President of Education. With a significant resource of
unique team building materials, she stirs group dynamics creating a rippling synergy.

In order to promote a bonding relationship between parents and their children during
the early learning stage, Zainab has founded the enterprise Zedesse
([www.zedesse.com](www.zedesse.com)). For 3 years now, the Company keeps on bringing new ideas to
parents and children so that concepts of spelling, word building, and sentence
structures become more understandable.

Zainab’s passion for poetry and photography deeply rooted in the of wonders of
Nature carried her from leaves to flowers, to trees to branches and soon she found
herself amidst the moon and the stars as her veins inked poetic verses. This is the
beginning of her new journey at International Astronomical Union – National
Outreach Committee (IAU NOC).
