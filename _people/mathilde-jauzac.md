I first visited Mauritius almost 15 years ago as some of my family moved there. Since then I have been coming back every year to visit them, and started doing some outreach locally during the annular eclipse back in 2016. I really enjoy interactions with kids and youth more generally as they are usually bias-free and have absolutely no filter ! It makes every interactions completely different from each other and I love that unpredictable side ! I had the chance to do such interventions in Mauritius several times by visiting several primary schools, the last ones being in May 2019.
