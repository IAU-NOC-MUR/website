Hello! I am lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Mauritius (UoM). Prior to that, I spent the most of 6 years working in the education sector in Mauritius. I worked for 2 years on education policy in the Tertiary Education & Scientific Research directorate of the Ministry of Education; for some time as a lecturer in mathematics education at the Mauritius Institute of Education educating teachers at the primary and secondary levels; for a year as a lecturer in mathematics at the local branch of a French _grande école_ in engineering and science; and for 2 years as a research officer in educational assessment (with focus on mathematics and the sciences) at the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate. I am deeply passionate about mathematics, physics, and education. I originally trained as a mathematical physicist, earning a PhD in Applied Mathematics (String Theory and Gauge/Gravity dualities). I am the co-founder of the _Café Scientifique Maurice_ science outreach initiative.
