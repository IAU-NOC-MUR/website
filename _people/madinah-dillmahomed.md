I am currently a Physics educator at Modern College, Flacq. I completed my bachelors in Physics with a Minor in Astrophysics at the University of Mauritius, after which I joined the Mauritius Institute of Education for a Post Graduate Certificate in Education. I am particularly interested in promoting science subjects and contributing to mitigate the gender gap in STEM fields.
