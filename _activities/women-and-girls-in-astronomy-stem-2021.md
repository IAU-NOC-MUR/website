As part of the global project for Women and Girls in Astronomy, our members shared their personal message to all girls and women who want to pursue Astronomy/STEM-related professional careers and/or get involved in Astronomy outreach.

Women and Girls in Astronomy is a global science communication project of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) that aims to promote and highlight the role of women in advancing science and encouraging young people to consider careers in astronomy.
