The Great Conjunction in radio captured by the Very Large Array, VLA at a wavelength of 2 cm (15 GHz). While Saturn is similar to optical _(left)_, Jupiter’s radio emission _(right)_ originates from charged particles accelerated in the magnetic fields around the planet which are being supplied by its volcanic moon, Io. This causes more emissions associated with the magnetic field compared to Saturn.

### **Is this the only one?**

On 21 December 2020, Jupiter and Saturn will appear exceptionally close as seen from Earth (separated by a mere 0.1°; i.e., just a fifth of the full moon’s size!). Conjunctions between them happen every 20 years (19.5 to be exact). But what about conjunctions between other pairs of planets?

**Upcoming conjunctions to look out for:**

21 Dec 2020 - Jupiter & Saturn (0.1 deg separation)

13 July 2021 - Venus & Mars (0.5 deg separation)

5 April 2022 - Mars & Saturn (0.3 deg separation)

30 April 2022 - Venus & Jupiter (0.2 deg separation)

29 May 2022 - Mars & Jupiter (0.6 deg separation).

All planets go around the Sun in their orbits which are slightly inclined to one another. This is why the separation between the two planets is a bit different for every conjunction, depending on where they are in their orbits. For example, the conjunctions during 2000, 2020, 2040, 2060, and 2080 have separations of 1.2°, 0.1°, 1.2°, 1.2°, and 0.1° respectively. Reference: African Astronomical Society (AfAS).

### **Fun Facts**

1. Ancient astronomers studied the motion of planets by noting their positions every few days against the background stars. You can do the same too, at least for Venus and Mars which move quite fast.
2. If you were standing on the Sun on 21 December and did not burn up, you would see triple conjunction of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn.
3. The Great conjunction that will happen 5521 years from now will be so close that Jupiter will actually eclipse Saturn, and pass directly in front of it!
4. Sometimes, the Moon and Sun are in conjunction too. We call these events, lunar and solar eclipses.
5. The 21 Dec 2020 great conjunction will be so close that you can see both planets in the same field of view in a small telescope.
6. _Syzygy_ (pronunciation: “SIZ-eh-gee” is the name for the nearly straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies (e.g., Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar and lunar eclipse) in a gradational system.
