In line with the International Astronomical Union (IAU) 100th anniversary celebration, Mauritians have been invited to name an Exoplanet, WASP-72 b, in the constellation of Fornax.

1\. After a first round where Mauritians submitted names of exoplanets,  the IAU National Outreach Coordinator (IAU-NOC) of Mauritius committee has shortlisted 5 names and you are invited to cast your vote.

2\. In the second round, we will short list the top 3 names that will be submitted to the IAU NameExoworlds committee for final choice. 

3\. You are also invited to participate in the naming of the exoplanet's parent star! Please leave your suggestion below.
