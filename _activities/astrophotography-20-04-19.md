## POSTPONED TO NEXT SATURDAY 20TH of April because of cloudy and rainy weather.

Attention to all of you who have your heads in the sky!

.

We're doing an Astrophotography event Next Saturday Night as from 22h. It's okay if you don't own a camera, we'll be demonstrating with ours. 

.

The plan is to photograph both the moon and the milky way - the moon sets just a bit after midnight, so we'll get a clear view on the milky way after that.

.

The deadline to sign up for this event is Thursday 11th April. We are going to choose the number of people and the location depending on how many people respond to this event.

.

Budding photographers, you're going to need a Tripod. 

.

Only sign up if you are coming. 

.

NOTE: Do tell us if you have a car - so we can look into carpooling.
