On 17 December 2019 the names of 112 sets of exoplanets and host stars named in the IAU100 NameExoWorlds campaigns were announced at a press conference in Paris (France). Within the framework of the International Astronomical Unionâ€™s 100th anniversary commemorations (IAU100) in 2019, 112 countries organised national campaigns that stimulated the direct participation of over 780 000 people worldwide, who proposed and selected names for each exoplanet and its host star.You can find details of each national campaign per continent on this section.

Mauritians have participated in the naming of the Exoplanet, [WASP-72 b](https://wasp-planets.net/naming/wasp-72/), in the constellation of Fornax. WASP-72 b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a F-type star. After 3 rounds of name submission and voting, the approved names are finally out!
